# Wireframing 
## Brief Overview
A wireframe can be as simple as a sketch. 

Just like a recipe before cooking a delicious meal or a blueprint an architect uses before building a house, a wireframe helps you visualize the content, structure, and overall flow of your website before you start building.

You can start simple using hand-drawn wireframes using pen and paper (the fastest way to get your ideas down). Then move to digital wireframes, which are easier to share with your team or clients.

> Effective planning and costing.

## Key Elements of Wireframing
### Layout Structure
This is basically how you organize your page. It's the overall arrangement of sections like headers, sidebars, and footers. For example, deciding if your homepage has a big hero image at the top or a grid of product cards helps determine how users will scan your page.

### Navigation
This shows how people will move around your site. Things like menus, search bars, and breadcrumbs help users find what they need. Good navigation in your wireframe might show that users can get from the homepage to any product page in just two clicks.

### Content Placement
This is figuring out where text, images, buttons, and forms go. For instance, putting your most important info "above the fold" (visible without scrolling) makes sure users see it right away. Your wireframe might show where product descriptions go versus where product images appear.

### Functionality
This covers the interactive parts - what happens when someone clicks a button or fills out a form. In your wireframe, you might show dropdown menus, accordions that expand, or pop-up windows that appear after certain actions.

## Types of Wireframes
| **Wireframe Type**       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                             | **Best Used When**                                                                                                            | **Benefits**                                                                                   |

| **Low-Fidelity Wireframes**  | Basic sketches focused on layout and structure. Often hand-drawn or made with simple digital tools.                                                                        | - You're brainstorming ideas  <br> - Need to quickly test different layouts <br> - Early feedback sessions                      | - Super quick to create <br> - Easy to discard and iterate <br> - Helps capture initial ideas without focusing on details |
| **High-Fidelity Wireframes** | More detailed and closer to the final product. Includes accurate layout, real content, and basic visuals like buttons or shading.                                            | - After settling on a layout <br> - When more detailed feedback is needed <br> - Before full mockups <br> - For stakeholder communication | - Offers a clearer picture of the final product <br> - Helps with detailed feedback <br> - Easier for non-designers to understand |

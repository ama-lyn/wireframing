# Wireframing 
## Brief Overview
A wireframe can be as simple as a sketch. 

Just like a recipe before cooking a delicious meal or a blueprint an architect uses before building a house, a wireframe helps you visualize the content, structure, and overall flow of your website before you start building.

You can start simple using hand-drawn wireframes using pen and paper (the fastest way to get your ideas down). Then move to digital wireframes, which are easier to share with your team or clients.
